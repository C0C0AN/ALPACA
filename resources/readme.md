| [tutorials]()  | tutorials (jupyter notebooks) related to different parts of ALPACA (e.g. [extract ROIs from atlases](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/open_science_fellowship_project/blob/master/resources/tutorials/ALPACA_atlas_to_ROI.ipynb), [create docker files](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/open_science_fellowship_project/blob/master/resources/tutorials/ALPACA_create_docker.ipynb), [comprehensive data preparation](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/open_science_fellowship_project/blob/master/resources/tutorials/ALPACA_data_organization_prerequisites.ipynb), etc.) that can also easily adapted for other purposes and topics| 
| [example data]() | example raw (structural and functional MR images & eeg files) and preprocessed data ([quality control using MRIQC]() & [structural preprocessing using mindboggle]())
| [regions of interest](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/open_science_fellowship_project/tree/master/resources/regions_of_interest)| auditory regions of interest, extracted from open, free and publicly available altases to be used within ALPACA |
| [neuroinformatics](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/open_science_fellowship_project/tree/master/resources/neuroinformatics) | information regarding neuroinformatics things that started and/or were gathered through ALPACA, like e.g. the [open neuroscience server system](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/open_science_fellowship_project/blob/master/resources/neuroinformatics/server_specifications.md) at the [Core-Unit Brainimaging](http://www.ukgm.de/ugm_2/deu/umr_psy/6618.html), [Faculty of Medicine](https://www.uni-marburg.de/fb20), [University of Marburg](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en)
