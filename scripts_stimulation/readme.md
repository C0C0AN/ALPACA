## Natural sounds experiment
This script is written to replicate the stimulation protocol described in:
- Santoro R, Moerel M, De Martino F, Valente G, Ugurbil K, Yacoub E, Formisano E (2017) Reconstructing the spectrotemporal modulations of real-life sounds from fMRI response patterns. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 114(18): 4799â€“4804. <https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1617622114>

Sound files should be downloaded from the Data Dryad repository under title `DesignProtocolsStimuli_Experiment2`:
