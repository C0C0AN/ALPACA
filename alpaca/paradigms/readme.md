# ALPACA experiments & paradigms

Within here, you'll find the experiments and paradigms included in ALPACA to localize and parcellate auditory cortex structures. In more detail it contains two approaches frequently uilized for these purposes: classic tonotopy and natural sounds. Regarding both you'll find implementaions in [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org/) and background information related to the design, as well as references.
