Throughout the last few years, two specific types of stimuli became more and more established: [natural sounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sounds) and [pure tones (bursts)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_tone#Pure_tone).\n",

    "Now, finally, let's get to work and create the above described stimuli. As for most things, first: there's a python package that will help you greatly and second: someone already did something comparable, so we don't have to start from scratch when generating pure tone bursts. An amazing resource that helps you getting started to work with any kind of audio stimuli / files for nearly every purpose is the [awesome-python-scientific-audio repository on github](https://github.com/faroit/awesome-python-scientific-audio). It's a list of python packages organized based on types of applications / analyses within audio research and is very comprehensive. Furthermore, it contains other useful resources such as [tutorials](https://github.com/faroit/awesome-python-scientific-audio#tutorials), [books](https://github.com/faroit/awesome-python-scientific-audio#books), [articles](https://github.com/faroit/awesome-python-scientific-audio#scientific-papers) and [much more](https://github.com/faroit/awesome-python-scientific-audio#other-resources)."
