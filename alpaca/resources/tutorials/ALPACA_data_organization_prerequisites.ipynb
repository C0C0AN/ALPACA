If you already have converted your data from [dicom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM) to [nifti](www.nifti.nimh.nih.gov/) the easist way would be to write a small bash/python/matlab/etc. script that reorganizes you files into BIDS. However, if you still have your files in dicom, it's recommend to convert them again using certain tools, like those which are listed [here](https://neurostars.org/t/convert-data-to-bids-format/720), as they allow you to extract more metadata than is usually present in your niftis and also already organize your dataset into BIDS.

    "Assuming your data is in BIDS format, de-identified and the BIDS validator had nothing to complain, it's time to let the games begin. Along the initial steps of analyzing neuroimaging data (or basically any other data as well) some sort of data quality control should be done. This is important, as checking for [artifacts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4340093/), [inhomogeneities](http://www.mr-tip.com/serv1.php?type=db1&dbs=Inhomogeneity) or any other kind of data corruption can prevent effects of the mentioned possible problems on your analyses and results. An example is depicted below (modified from Esteban O, Birman D, Schaer M, Koyejo OO, Poldrack RA, Gorgolewski KJ (2017) MRIQC: Advancing the automatic prediction of image quality in MRI from unseen sites.

    "##### What exactly is [MRIQC](http://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)?\n",
    "\n",
    "MRI Quality Control Tool (MRIQC) is tool for automated quality assessment which it does by extracting (image) quality measures. The [introduction page of MRIQC](http://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html) provides a comprehensive overview of it's functions and properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "MRIQC is an open-source project, developed under the following software engineering principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modularity and integrability: MRIQC implements a [nipype](http://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [workflow](http://miykael.github.io/nipype-beginner-s-guide/firstSteps.html#important-building-blocks) to integrate modular sub-workflows that rely upon third party software toolboxes such as [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki), [ANTs](http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/) and [AFNI](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov).\n",
    "2. Minimal preprocessing: the MRIQC workflows should be as minimal as possible to estimate the IQMs on the original data or their minimally processed derivatives.\n",
    "3. Interoperability and standards: MRIQC follows the the [brain imaging data structure (BIDS)](http://bids.neuroimaging.io), and it adopts the [BIDS-App](http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io) standard.\n",
    "4. Reliability and robustness: the software undergoes frequent vetting sprints by testing its robustness against data variability (acquisition parameters, physiological differences, etc.) using images from [OpenfMRI](https://openfmri.org). Its reliability is permanently checked and maintained with [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/poldracklab/mriqc).\n",
    "\n",
    "MRIQC is part of the MRI image analysis and reproducibility platform offered by the [CRN](http://reproducibility.stanford.edu). This pipeline derives from, and is heavily influenced by, the [PCP Quality Assessment Protocol](http://preprocessed-connectomes-project.org/quality-assessment-protocol/)."

Please be aware, that as MRIQC is a [BIDS app](http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io) it assumes that your dataset is in BIDS format.

    "So, what to do with all this comprehensive quality related information? Besides being amazed and overwhelmed by this incredibly useful open source tool, you should definitely make us of it's output. E.g. check overall quality and stability, control for outliers, etc. . You can do this visually, or, of course, with regard to reproducibility, at least for structural images, using a high end function that's already included in MRIQC. More precisely, MRIQC comes with a [already included, defined and pre-trained classifier](https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/classifier.html) to predict if certain samples in a dataset should be accepted or rejected. This is based on a [random forrest classifier](https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cv/base.html#the-random-forests-classifier-in-mriqc) which was trained on a combination of the [ABIDE](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/) and \n",

    "Most neuroimaging pipelines / workflows, like the ALPACA toolbox, incoporate structural images at some point. Either as a sole focus or within a multi-modal way, e.g. together with functional images for coregistration. There is, of course, a huge varierity for both, the first and the latter. But why not use a pipeline that includes both and covers the vast majority of possible use cases and subsequent analyses? Can't think of any reason? Me neither! Hence, let me introduce you to [mindboggle](http://www.mindboggle.info). As mentioned before, [mindboggle](http://www.mindboggle.info) is a very easy to apply, comprehensive, open & reproducible software package/pipeline for structural image processing.

Running the complete [mindboggle](http://www.mindboggle.info) workflow will provide you with e.g. [segmentations](http://mindhive.mit.edu/node/106), [surface reconstruction](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FreeSurferAnalysisPipelineOverview#TheSurface-basedStream) and [in-depth subtle measures of label, feature and shape information in volume, surface and tabular data](http://mindboggle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#appendix-output).

    "  --> ALPACA highly profits from the mindboggle pipeline. For example, the structural pipeline of ALPACA uses the FreeSurfer & ANTs segmentations &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and labels / parcellations for the generation of ROIs in volume and surface format in native & reference space. Additionally, those outputs are used &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to transform ROIs from divers atlases into participant's native space. Furthermore, they are also very important in ALPACA's functional pipeline, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.g. during coregistration, normalization and volume/surface based 1st level statistics. The diverse and in depth measures also provide amazing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;details with regard to structure-function relationships (e.g. correlations of structural properties with functional profiles) and also enhance the fine &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grained analyses of the auditory cortex in general, as well as the possible influence of certain factors like age, musical training, etc. .
